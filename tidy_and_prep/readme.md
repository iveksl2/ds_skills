Datasets structered in a [tidy format](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) provide a standerdized way to format the data for analysis 

    * Benefits: 
        * Can reuse tools to spend less time in data prep and more in analysis. Subsequent analysis and plotting will require less complex code.  Once dataset is tidy manipulating data can be limited to Filter, Select, Mutate, Summarise. Makes it easy to read & reproduce.
        * Maps data to the the grammer of graphics plotting libraries across languages. I.E. ggplot & plotly express.
